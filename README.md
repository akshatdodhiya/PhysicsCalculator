# Physics Calculator Documentation
## Introduction
The Physics Calculator is a command-line application designed to perform various calculations related to electricity and physics. It provides four main calculation options: Ohm's Law Calculator, Electric Field Intensity Calculator, Coulomb's Law Calculator, and Power Calculator.

## Features
1. Ohm's Law Calculator: This calculator allows you to calculate voltage, current, or resistance using Ohm's Law formulas.

2. Electric Field Intensity Calculator: Calculate electric field intensity, force, or charge using appropriate physics formulas.

3. Coulomb's Law Calculator: Calculate the force between charges, given charge values and distance.

4. Power Calculator: Calculate power, voltage, or current using relevant equations.
## Usage
1. Run the program, and a main menu will be displayed with the available options.
2. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.

## Main Menu
```
Please choose an option:
1. Ohm's Law
